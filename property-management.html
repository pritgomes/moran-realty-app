							<p class="darker-text" data-animation-direction="from-left" data-animation-delay="200">Why invest in property?</p>

							<p  data-animation-direction="from-left" data-animation-delay="250">Investment in property is one of the most stable forms of growing your wealth. Whilst markets change, and prices of property rise and fall, the cycle always continues. They key is to buy when the market is down, and sell when the market is up - this will almost gaurantee a return on your investment. If you would like to grow or start an investment portfolio, talk to your Moran Realty agent to find out more about what options there are for investing in property.</p>

							<p data-animation-direction="from-left" data-animation-delay="300">As an investment property owner, you want to know that your property or properties are being managed by a team of professional ethical and caring people. This is what Moran Realty strive to achieve for all of their investment property owners (Landlords).

							<p data-animation-direction="from-left" data-animation-delay="350">Property management is an industry that undergoes legislative changes constantly, so it is important that you can be assured your investments are being managed by people who are informed and follow the right procedures to get the maximum return for you. By choosing Moran Realty, you are choosing a Property Managemnt team that is fully trained in all aspects of property management and who understand the obligation of landlord's and tenants.</p>

							<p data-animation-direction="from-left" data-animation-delay="400">We have outlined a few key points for you to consider when choosing a managing agency for your investment property/properties.</p>

							<p data-animation-direction="from-left" data-animation-delay="450">Selecting the right property manager.</p>

							<p data-animation-direction="from-left" data-animation-delay="500">Selecting the right property manager is one of the most fundamental decisions you'll make and can make a difference not only to your overall returns, but also the enjoyment of your investment.</p>

							<p data-animation-direction="from-left" data-animation-delay="550">Over the last few years, property management has undergone a significant transformation, from simply a rent collection service, to a dynamic investment management and service system. This changing scene has brought about the need to appropriately manage new legislation and the consequences to ensure fairness for both owners and tenants alike. This includes, in some regions, the Strata Titles Act, Residential Tenancies Act and deregulation of fees charged.</p>
